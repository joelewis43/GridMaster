Using the below html table, can you make it into a JSON list based on the below outline (table column headers in parenthesis)?
row (Row)
col (Task)
difficulty (Difficulty)
task (Task Description)
title (first line of Unlock Description)
reward (the rest of the Unlock Description)
reward should be a single string, not a list. You can separate lines with a newline character instead.
